/// This ``InfineonNBTPTApp`` struct conforms to the `App` SwiftUI protocol and serves as the main
/// entry point of the iOS application.
///
/// Usage:
/// - Use the `@main` attribute to mark this struct as the entry point of the app.
/// - The struct defines the `body` property, which represents the root of the app's view
///   hierarchy.
/// - The `body` property returns a `Scene` that contains the main window of the app.
/// - The main window is created using the `WindowGroup` scene type.
/// - The content of the main window is set to an instance of the ``SplashScreenView`` view.

    /// Usage:
    /// - The body property is a computed property that returns a Scene type.
    /// - It is used to define the structure and content of the app scene.
    /// - The some Scene syntax indicates an opaque result type, allowing flexibility in
    /// returning different types conforming to the Scene protocol.
